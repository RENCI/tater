"""Demonstrates the on_save hook and the escape-hatch callback pattern.

on_save hook
------------
``on_save`` is not defined at module level here because its audit path
depends on the app's annotations path, which is only known at runtime.
Instead, ``configure`` sets ``app.on_save`` after the app is created.

Escape hatch
------------
``configure`` also registers a Dash callback that clears ``pet_mood``
whenever ``needs_attention`` is unchecked — a cross-field rule that can't be
expressed as a widget declaration.  It runs after ``set_annotation_widgets``
so that Tater's component IDs are already finalised.
